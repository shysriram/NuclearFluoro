# NuclearFluoro
NuclearFluoro is a reproducible pipeline for nuclear detection and per-nuclear fluorescence quantification in microscopy images. This project intends to standardize how raw fluorescence images are converted into analysis-ready quantitative outputs that are interpretable and reusable across datasets. 

While NuclearFluoro does not propose a new segmentaton algorithm, it treats segmentation as the backend within a broader measurement pipeline focused on reproducibility and downstream usability. 

The pipeline operates on any fluorescence micrscopy data containing nuclear stains. We demonstrate its use on colon cancer microscopy data as a representative application.
